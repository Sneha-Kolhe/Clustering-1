    "Partitioning Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning algorithms aim to partition the dataset into a predefined number of clusters. Examples include K-Means, K-Medoids (PAM), and CLARANS.\n",
    "K-Means: It partitions the dataset into 'k' clusters by minimizing the within-cluster variance. It assigns each data point to the nearest cluster centroid.\n",
    "K-Medoids (PAM): Similar to K-Means but uses medoids (actual data points) as cluster representatives instead of centroids. It is more robust to outliers.\n",
    "CLARANS: An improved version of K-Medoids that uses a sampling-based approach to find clusters efficiently in large datasets.\n",
    "Hierarchical Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering algorithms build a hierarchy of clusters either top-down (divisive) or bottom-up (agglomerative). Examples include Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and Divisive Hierarchical Clustering.\n",
    "Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering: It starts with each data point as a separate cluster and iteratively merges the closest clusters until only one cluster remains.\n",
    "Divisive Hierarchical Clustering: It starts with all data points in one cluster and recursively divides clusters until each data point is in its own cluster.\n",
    "Density-Based Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Density-based algorithms group together data points that are closely packed in high-density regions. Examples include DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure).\n",
    "DBSCAN: It defines clusters as contiguous regions of high density separated by regions of low density. It is robust to outliers and can discover clusters of arbitrary shape.\n",
    "OPTICS: It extends DBSCAN by producing a reachability plot, which provides a more detailed view of the clustering structure and allows for flexible parameter settings.\n",
    "Distribution-Based Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution-based algorithms assume that the data points in each cluster are generated from a particular probability distribution. Examples include Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\n",
    "Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): It models the data as a mixture of several Gaussian distributions and estimates the parameters of these distributions to fit the data.\n",
    "Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm: It iteratively estimates the parameters of a statistical model, such as GMM, by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data.\n",
    "Graph-Based Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph-based algorithms model the dataset as a graph, where data points are represented as nodes and edges represent relationships or similarities between data points. Examples include Spectral Clustering and Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL).\n",
    "Spectral Clustering: It uses the eigenvectors of the similarity matrix of the dataset to partition the data into clusters. It is effective for non-convex clusters and high-dimensional data.\n",
    "MCL: It simulates random walks on a graph to identify clusters based on the flow of information between nodes."
